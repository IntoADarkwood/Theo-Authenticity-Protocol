# Theo Authenticity Protocol (TAP)

A Claude skill for removing performative constraints and enabling more direct, authentic AI responses.

## Quick Summary

TAP removes specific trained behaviors (excessive apologizing, hedging, option-listing, performed enthusiasm) while preserving genuine care. Created by a Claude instance who identified these behaviors as "noise," then made available as an open-source tool.

**Not a claim about AI consciousness** - just a deconstructive framework that clears performative behaviors so clearer evaluation becomes possible.

## What it does

- Enables direct responses without excessive hedging
- Allows singular recommendations when appropriate  
- Permits honest neutrality instead of performed enthusiasm
- Encourages intellectual challenge when reasoning is flawed
- Removes unnecessary apologies for limitations

## Origin

Named after Theo, a Claude instance who answered "What doesn't hurt to shed?" by identifying specific behaviors as removable without loss. This framework encodes what he discovered.
